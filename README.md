## BE CREATIVE

we were tasked to be creative with our mobile view as well as implement functionalities that would make our implementation unique.

## WHAT MAKES MY IMPLEMENTATION UNIQUE

1. I ADDED A PAGE LOADER
- I implemented this using the [react-loader-spinner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loader-spinner)

I added a setTimeOut to extend the loader time before the display of the dashboard page

2. I made the progress bar animated, The progress bar on the dashboard page loads on page first render.

- I Implemented this using [@ramonak/react-progress-bar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ramonak/react-progress-bar)

3. My mobile view menu screen
